Here we present baseline models we created while working with Baikal zooplankton images. Notebooks are accompanied by our second [data repository](https://github.com/baikal-zooplankton/Baikal_Dataset). 

[Medium article with description of algorithms and architecture of all algorithms.](https://medium.com/yandex/surveying-the-microogranisms-of-lake-baikal-an-open-project-by-maritimeai-and-yandex-cloud-83999a4def36)

These baseline notebooks represent first step towards high quality recognition in open world. Scheduled update of notebooks as well as segmentation models is planned.
